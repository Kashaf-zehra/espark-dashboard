Dashboard Project Overview

I developed  with my team a comprehensive dashboard using Next.js that caters to three distinct user roles: clients, employees, and superadmins. This project exemplifies my proficiency in building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. Here's a brief overview of the project:

Client Dashboard:

User Interface: Designed a clean and intuitive interface for clients to manage their profiles, view project updates, and communicate with support.
Features: Clients can view their project status, access documents, and receive notifications about important updates.

Employee Dashboard:

Task Management: Developed functionalities for employees to view assigned tasks, update progress, and collaborate with team members.
Time Tracking: Implemented a time tracking feature to log hours spent on tasks, enhancing productivity and accountability.

Superadmin Dashboard:

User Management: Provided superadmins with powerful tools to manage users, including creating, updating, and deleting client and employee accounts.
Analytics and Reports: Built comprehensive analytics and reporting features to monitor project performance, employee productivity, and overall business metrics.
Technical Highlights:

Next.js: Utilized Next.js to build a server-side rendered application, ensuring fast load times and improved SEO.
State Management: Implemented efficient state management using Redux, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.
Material-UI: Used Material-UI for consistent and aesthetically pleasing UI components across the dashboard.
Responsive Design: Ensured the dashboard is fully responsive, providing a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
